## Restitution

"this cup" not removed - Luke 22:41-44

"41 And He withdrew from them about a
stone’s throw and knelt down and prayed,
42 Saying, Father, if You are willing,
remove this cup from Me; yet not My will,
but [[f]always] Yours be done.

"43 And there appeared to Him an angel
from heaven, strengthening Him in spirit.
44 And being in an agony [of mind],
He prayed [all the] more earnestly and
intently, and His sweat became like
great [g]clots of blood dropping down
upon the ground.",
Luke 22:41-44 ([AMP][1])

- The Father of Jesus did not
"remove this cup from" Jesus,
because his Father was not "willing".

- The Father of Jesus did not
"remove this cup from" Job, Joseph or
those cheated by Zacchaeus, either.

If the Father of Jesus had removed
those four "cups":

- **Those cheated** by Zacchaeus
would not have been **restored**
"four times as much".

- **Job**
would not have been **restored**
"twice as much".

- **Joseph**
would not have been **restored**
many times his own life by being both
spared and
keeping "many people" alive.

- **Jesus**
would not have been **restored**
many times his own life by being both
resurrected and
becoming the "first fruits".

Instead, the Father of Jesus was,
"… not desiring that any should perish,
…", 2 Peter 3:9 ([AMP][1]), and therefore
was "willing" to allow
innocent, sinless Jesus to be
murdered by Satan so that
**Jesus** would then have to be **restored**
many times his own life by being both
resurrected and
becoming the "first fruits".

- "20 But now [as things really are] Christ
has in fact been raised from the dead,

- [and He became] the first fruits
[that is, the first to be resurrected
with an incorruptible, immortal body,
foreshadowing the resurrection]

- of those who have fallen asleep [in death].",
1 Corinthians 15:20 ([AMP][1])
