# Repentance

## Isaiah 55:6-9 with Galatians 5:19-23

### Motivation for Repentance

- "â€¦ not desiring that any should perish,

- but that all should turn to repentance.",
2 Peter 3:9 (AMP)

### Preparation for Repentance

- "19Now the doings (practices) of the
flesh are clear (obvious): they are

- immorality, impurity, indecency,
20Idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife,
jealousy, anger (ill temper),
selfishness, divisions (dissensions),
party spirit (factions, sects with
peculiar opinions, heresies),
21Envy, drunkenness, carousing,
and the like.",
Galatians 5:19-21a (AMP)

- 
- "I warn you beforehand,
just as I did previously,

- that those who do such things shall
not inherit the kingdom of God.",
Galatians 5:21b (AMP)

- 
- "22But the fruit of the [Holy] Spirit
[the work which His presence
within accomplishes] is

- love, joy (gladness), peace,
patience (an even temper, forbearance),
kindness, goodness (benevolence),
faithfulness,
23Gentleness (meekness, humility),
self-control (self-restraint, continence).

- Against such things there is no law
[that can bring a charge].",
Galatians 5:22-23 (AMP)

### Analysis of Repentance

As Given, Isaiah 55:6-9 (AMP)

- "6 Seek, inquire for, and require the Lord
while He may be found

- [claiming Him by necessity and by right];

- call upon Him while He is near.

- 
- "7 Let the wicked forsake his way

- and the unrighteous man his thoughts;

- 
- and let him return to the Lord,

- and He will have love, pity, and mercy for him,

- 
- and to our God,

- for He will multiply to him
His abundant pardon.

- 
- "8 For My thoughts are not your thoughts,

- neither are your ways My ways, says the Lord.

- 
- "9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth,

- 
- so are My ways higher than your ways

- and My thoughts than your thoughts."

In paragraph, or prose, form, as above,
many passages are hard to study,
like Romans. So, we spread things out,
like laying out the pieces of a puzzle,
to see what goes with what, etc.

As we spread things out, we will notice
certain things repeating themselves,
though often with different, or even
contrasting, wording, as in Proverbs.

We will also notice some things are not
explicitly stated, but are (obviously) implied.
These implied items must be in agreement
with the meaning/intent of all explicit items.

**KEY**: "==", "{}", Patterns

- "==": Equivalent meanings of words/phrases/lines.

- "{}" (braces): Commentary, often Scripture.

- {Pattern: A1A2 B1C1 B2C2}: Overall format of verses.

**Isaiah 55:6** (AMP), {Pattern: A1 == A2}

- A1: "6 Seek, inquire for, and require the Lord
while He may be found

- [claiming Him by necessity and by right];"

- A2: "call upon Him while He is near."

**Isaiah 55:7** (AMP), {Pattern: A1 == A2, B1C1 == B2C2}

- A1: "Let the wicked forsake his way {"immorality, ..."}"

- A2: "and the unrighteous man his thoughts {"immorality, ..."};"

- 
- B1: "and let him return to the Lord {"love, joy ..."}," {Repent}

- C1: "and He will have love, pity, and mercy for him,"

- 
- B2: "and {"return"} to our God {"love, joy ..."}," {Repent}

**Isaiah 55:9** (AMP), {Pattern: A1, B1 == B2}

- A1: "For as the heavens are higher than the earth,"

- {Contemporary analogy: As different as night and day!}

- 
- B1: "so are My ways {"love, joy ..."}
higher {different} than your ways {"immorality, ..."}"

- B2: "and My thoughts {"love, joy ..."}
{different} than your thoughts {"immorality, ..."}."
